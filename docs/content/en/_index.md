# Devi - Documentations

## What is deviï¼Ÿ

Devi is your AI agent building blocks. Building agentic workflow with generative AI is a new and innovative area, developers need to build many low level basic components before they can readlly focus on the actual valuable workflow. We want to simplify the complexity of this process by building a set of common AI agent components. 

## Get Started with Devi

Devi offers two ways for developers to use: the first is to provide an out-of-the-box experience through the **GitHub Copilot Extension**, and the second is to provide more customization capabilities through the **Devi NPM Package**.

### GitHub Copilot Extension

**Devi for GitHub Copilot** is a series of AI agents built on the GitHub Copilot ecosystem. Devi provides the atomic capabilities of these agents and provides services to developers through GitHub Copilot Chat. Developers can install the Devi extension through the Visual Studio Marketplace, and then use the `@devi` in GitHub Copilot Chat to implement out-of-the-box capabilities of the DB agent, such as: database conversations, Text2SQL, database document generation, etc.
